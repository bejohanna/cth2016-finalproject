This project  is a script that is suppose to create a prototype for an online webshop for beauty products. The scripts will make it possible for the user to see a list of products and necessary information about them. 

The information about the products is based on different variables in the script.

Here is one example:

var makeup = [
{'product': "True Match Liquid Foundation",
 'label': "Lor√©al Paris",
 'price': 12.79,
 'coulor': "Rose Vanilla 2C",
 'volume': "30 ml",
 'url': "http://boots.scene7.com/is/image/Boots/10200787?wid=200&hei=200&op_sharpen=1"
},

Html and css have been used to design the webpage. 


To test the script we used the http://localhost:8088/
